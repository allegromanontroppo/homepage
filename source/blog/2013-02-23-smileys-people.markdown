I spent last week watching an episode of 'Smiley's People' per day. I dad to read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia after to work out what was going on.

Of course it's still absolutely terrific though.

As spy I'd be like Denholm Eliott's character in Indiana Jones, "Hello? Does anybody here speak English?" and then stabbed with umbrella on day one.
