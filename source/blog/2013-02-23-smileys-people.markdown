I spent last week watching an episode of 'Smiley's People' per day. Unfortunately I had to read the plot synopsis on Wikipedia after to work out what was going on.

Of course it's still absolutely terrific though.

I'd be so useless as a spy. So not street-smart. I'd be like Denholm Eliott's character in Indiana Jones, "Hello? Does anybody here speak English?" and then stabbed with umbrella on day one.
